**Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server
providing 2-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your
applications via a web portal.
It acts as a companion of reverse proxies like [nginx], [Traefik] or [HAProxy] to let them know whether queries should pass through. Unauthenticated user are
redirected to Authelia Sign-in portal instead.

Documentation is available at https://docs.authelia.com.

The architecture is shown in the diagram below.

<p align="center" style="margin:50px">
  <img src="./docs/images/archi.png"/>
</p>

**Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/authelia/), [FreeBSD Ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/www/authelia/), or using a [Static binary](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/releases/latest),
[Docker] or [Kubernetes] leveraging ingress controllers and ingress configurations. Assistance to publish a [debian package](https://github.com/authelia/authelia/issues/573) would be greatly appreciated.

For more details about the features, follow [Features](https://docs.authelia.com/features/).

If you want to know more about the roadmap, follow [Roadmap](https://docs.authelia.com/roadmap).

## Proxy support

Authelia works in combination with [nginx], [Traefik] or [HAProxy]. It can be deployed on bare metal with
Docker or on top of [Kubernetes].

## Getting Started

You can start utilising Authelia with the provided `docker-compose` bundles:

#### [Local](https://docs.authelia.com/getting-started)
The Local compose bundle is intended to test Authelia without worrying about configuration.
It's meant to be used for scenarios where the server is not be exposed to the internet.
Domains will be defined in the local hosts file and self-signed certificates will be utilised.

#### [Lite](https://docs.authelia.com/deployment/deployment-lite)
The Lite compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt.
The Lite element refers to minimal external dependencies; File based user storage, SQLite based configuration storage. In this configuration, the service will not scale well.

#### [Full](https://docs.authelia.com/deployment/deployment-ha)
The Full compose bundle is intended for scenarios where the server will be exposed to the internet, domains and DNS will need to be setup accordingly and certificates will be generated through LetsEncrypt.
The Full element refers to a scalable setup which includes external dependencies; LDAP based user storage, Database based configuration storage (MariaDB, MySQL or Postgres). 

## Deployment

Now that you have tested **Authelia** and you want to try it out in your own infrastructure,
you can learn how to deploy and use it with [Deployment](https://docs.authelia.com/deployment/deployment-ha).
This guide will show you how to deploy it on bare metal as well as on
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).

## Security

Authelia takes security very seriously. We follow the rule of
[responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure), and we
encourage the community to as well.

## Breaking changes

See [BREAKING](./BREAKING.md).

## Why Open Source?

You might wonder why Authelia is open source while it adds a great deal of security and user experience to your infrastructure at zero cost.
It is open source because we firmly believe that security should be available for all to benefit in the face the battlefield which is the Internet
with near zero effort.

Additionally, keeping the code open source is a way to leave it auditable by anyone who is willing to contribute. This way, you can be confident
that the product remains secure and does not act maliciously.

It's important to keep in mind Authelia is not directly exposed on the
Internet (your reverse proxies are) however, it's still the control plane for your internal security so take care of it!
